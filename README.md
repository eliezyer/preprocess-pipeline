# preprocess-pipeline
Code for preprocessing data in brito-sjulson lab.

The steps I'm working with are to:

[x] Robocopy all the files from my local folder to the my local folder NAS.

[ ] Create a session folder and put all the files from that animal/date inside the session folder

[ ] Concatenate files inside the NAS. Test for integrity of file

[ ] Run Kilosort2 automatically on the concatenated dataset

[ ] Run set of heuristics to automatically merge/exclude clusters from output of kilosort

[ ] Run DeepLabCut on video, extract data

[ ] Synchronize video with electrophysiology
